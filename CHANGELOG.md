- **Add HttpClient module**: Introduced a new HttpClient module for improved HTTP handling.
- **Add streaming read capability**: Added the capability of streaming read for LLM providers completions.
- **Documentation and config updates**: Updates to README.md and configuration files.

## [0.6.0] - 2025-07-17
- **Refactor Models to Providers**: Renamed the "Models" module to "Providers" to better reflect the architecture and improve code organization.
- **Fix optional ex_aws dependency**: Fixed the ex_aws dependency to be truly optional by adding missing `Code.ensure_loaded` checks that were making the dependency mandatory.

## [0.5.5] - 2025-07-08
- **Fix typos**: Fixed various typos throughout the codebase.

## [0.5.4] - 2025-07-07
- **Add support for structured outputs in OpenRouter**: Added functionality to support structured outputs when using the OpenRouter model.

## [0.5.3] - 2025-06-30
- **Remove provider_routing from OpenRouter**: Removed the `provider_routing` functionality from the OpenRouter model, simplifying the model configuration and request building process.

## [0.5.2] - 2025-06-19
- **Making `ex_aws` dependency optional**: `ex_aws` is only required for the Bedrock provider. Making it optional so it is not included in case Bedrock is not used. Additionally, removing the `Logger.error()` in case of a model error, delegating this to the caller of the library.

## [0.5.1] - 2025-06-12
- **Adjust `Message.content` specs**: For Bedrock, the `content` field of the message has to be a list, allowing for messages with with multi-type content (image + text).

## [0.5.0] - 2025-06-12
- **Include Bedrock Support**: Included Bedrock support as provider only with `completion()`s support.

## [0.3.5] - 2024-12-18
- **Fix default api_key setting value**: The default value was en empty string. Now it is nil to be evaluated as false when getting the key from the map later. 

## [0.3.4] - 2024-12-17
- **OpenAI API Keys**: Use an API key passed as a parameter when calling chat_completion â€” overriding the global API key defined in the config. The param is sent inside the settings. 

## [0.3.3] - 2024-12-04
- **Timeouts**: Configurable OpenAI's timeout. Default set to 50 seconds.

## [0.3.2] - 2024-12-03
- **Timeouts**: Fix OpenAI-timeout handling and increase Tesla's timeout to 5 seconds.

## [0.3.1] - 2024-10-14

### Added
- **Error Handling**: Introduced a new module `LlmComposer.Errors` with a custom `MissingKeyError` for better error management.
- **Removed Legacy Code**: Removed the `get_messages/4` function from `LlmComposer` to streamline message handling.

## [0.3.0] - 2024-10-10

### Added
- **System Prompt Handling**: Added support for an optional system prompt in `run_completion/3`. The `system_prompt` is now treated as `nil` when not provided.
- **Custom Message Flow Example**: Updated the `README.md` with an example of how to use the `run_completion/3` function directly with a custom message history.
- **Nil Message Handling in Models**: Handling the `nil` case when system_prompt not provided

## [0.2.0] - 2024-10-10

### Added
- Initial release with support for basic message handling, interaction with OpenAI and Ollama models, and a foundational structure for model settings and function execution.
